	 <h1> Sonnet 15: When I consider everything that grows </h1>
		<h3> BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE </h3>
			<img src="https://elearning.umu.ac.ug/pluginfile.php/1515/course/overviewfiles/Start%202%20End%20of%20Life.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

		<p> When I consider everything that grows
			<br> Holds in perfection but a little moment,
			<br> That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
			<br> Whereon the stars in secret influence comment; </p>

        <p> When I perceive that men as plants increase,
			<br> Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,
			<br> Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
			<br> And wear their brave state out of memory; </p>

		<p> Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
			<br> Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
			<br> Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
			<br> To change your day of youth to sullied night; </p>

		<p> And all in war with Time for love of you,
			<br> As he takes from you, I engraft you new. </p>
